# Manual Deployment Options

## Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `whatsapp-todo-ai` project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Latest commit should show: `✨ Add smart AI formatting...`
5. If it's building: Wait for it to finish
6. If NOT building: Click "Redeploy" button

## Option 2: Via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already)
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Option 3: Setup GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
If you don't have auto-deploy set up:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Add New" → "Project"
3. Import from GitHub: `samuelh165/Todo`
4. Configure and deploy
5. Future pushes to `main` will auto-deploy!

## Check Deployment Status
Once deployed, visit your production URL to test the new features!
